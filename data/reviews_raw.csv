B071JTJN3P,B071JTJN3P,4.0,"Cute, comfy, stay on well","So far (after excitedly trying all of them on right after each other) I really like these headbands! The colors and patterns are so cute. The striped ones are a silkier fabric while the floral printed ones are a more textured fabric. These don't stretch all the way around your head like many headbands do, you have to stretch it over your head around where you want it to be and then style your hair from there. Not the best pick for a quick hair fix, perhaps a standard elastic headband would be best for that! They seem to be pretty sturdy on the head; a lot of headbands can tend to slip around or even fall off. I didn't wear these for a long time, but I tested their strength by moving my head around and they stayed pretty much in place. They are a tad bit more narrow than I had anticipated, but you can sort of splat out the fabric if you like a wider headband like me. I attached a few of the pictures I took while trying them out. I love how they look with my hair both up and down! It adds a touch of flair and class to even a simple bun. Overall I really like these. They fit the style I was looking for with a great price.

I haven’t had the need to use the glove or clips (yet) since I chopped off my long hair right before purchasing, but I think the glove will come in handy if used with longer hair (shoulder length or longer).  I think this product will work best for longer hair, but it has helped my chin/shoulder length hair to smooth out before I start my day.

So far so good except for the thinness of the hair. It is suggested to use two to three packs bit with these you'll need 3 or 4. This is hard for my type of thin hair as when i use more than a pack and a half you can see the tape thru my hair. Overall im satisfied with this purchase because of the customer service and trying to make the customer happy, although i will go back to my old brand due to the wefts not having much hair on them.

That being said I began to see these face rollers for dirt cheap all over amazon but surely I was not going to buy a cheap product for my face I mean a lady needs to keep these fine lines at bay lol I needed a quality product and if it were cute double win.<br /><br />Anyway I found this Jane & Co roller and stone set and I thought ehh $30 or so for the roller and stone thingy it ought to be a better made product right?! Wrong!! Unfortunately I just received my package last night and was so excited to use it this AM and from the pic you can tell they can have a great thing going from packaging to the personal note which made me smile. However just taking my roller out of the package not even using it ONCE it was broken 🙁😔😢😣 the reason I personally spent more than double on this set as opposed to those other cheap ones was to not have to deal with a faulty product but honestly you can not say you get what you pay for with this roller! It is so cute too, what a disappointment!<br /><br />So I returned the initial roller and stone set but for the same item hoping with all hope that the subsequent roller would be better quality. However it is not (check out pics posted) I really wanted to love this roller because black is my color and the package is adorns but this is just ridiculous unnacceptable and a waste of my time and money!!

B006WZD7FW,B006WZD7FW,5.0,Fresh as a daisy,"I normally get the normal Salux from my local Asian grocery, pharmacy, or beauty store. I often get compliments on my soft skin, which I attribute to using this to exfoliate and moisturizing immediately after a shower, but before toweling off. The Salux design works really well to get hard to reach spots like your back and the bottoms of your feet. I've tried off brand towel washcloths and loofah fibers were way too soft. It was time to replace my regular Salux, but after recently moving, it wasn't a priority to get a new one, and was without for a couple weeks.<br /><br />I don't really get body acne, but I felt crusty and clogged for going a couple of weeks without exfoliating! I could feel hair conditioner on my back not fully rinsed away, even though I showered every day.After getting settled in to my new place, I had finally had it and placed an order for this ""hard""(lol) version. The tasteful grey color actually matched the color scheme of my new bathroom.  The first shower that I took once I received this was so refreshing! I felt like a snake shedding its skin, like a Phoenix reborn in cleansing fire. It was the satisfaction of scratching an itch except the itch is on your entire body. I love the feeling of a brand new Salux! Hopefully the ""hard"" version sustains that feeling for longer. It's holy grail right now, until I can find something that's as effective but zero waste. On that note, a Salux is more hygienic and sustainable than a regular loofah because the knotted fibers of a loofah don't dry completely and are therefore more susceptible to bacteria and mildeww growth.",1594202471489,True,6

You can find it in stores for as low as $0.85-$1, but it's only available in 12 ounces, whereas Suave Coconut is $1.50 for 33 ounces. So in the long run, this particular scent is not the best purchase for your money. My favorite Suave is Everlasting Sunshine and Coconut, which work even more amazingly on my hair but come in larger sizing with more pleasant scents.

I wanted to try it because I have terrible ingrown hair everywhere on my legs (I wax), cellulite plus skins a little loose on my tummy (3 kids)... So my ideas for this were exfoliation, reduce cellulite appearance and tighten skin. So far, I have noticed how it's easier to see the hairs stuck under the surface which means it is doing a good job already exfoliating. I also notice my skin looks less bumpy and more fresh. My goal is to use it 3x/week. I will return in a few weeks with updated results.<br /><br />The Oil: What a heavenly scent... I'm using it on my neck down to my toes and the feeling of my skin - looks and feels, smooth, silky, succulent (can I say that?) Plus, the scent is light enough you could add perfume if desired; i usually do when I get to work a couple hours later and don't even smell the oil by then. I LOVE this oil!

B00KHVAOAS,B0C5KJM4TB,5.0,"A Must Have, REALLY!  Buy It!!!","Just so you know, I have seen the original version of this glove for awhile & have been extremely skeptical about how useful it could be. It looked silly to me even with one thumb, LOL! However, I am coming off of two arm and hand surgeries back to back (right & left ) & all my brushes were extremely dirty and I was dreading washing them like the plague. (I'm still recovering so my hands & arms are only at 80% strength) I ran across this new version & watched the video on Sigma's site and thought I would try it out because I really needed something to make this easier right now.<br /><br />I have many brushes including a bunch of big dense ones like the SigMax brushes. I loath the chore of washing my brushes. I do it less often than I should. My hands become prunes, I wreck my nails and it takes for-like-ever! Plus, I can never seem to get the big dense ones clean enough deep in the center no matter how long I stand there and try to wash them.<br /><br />Today I used this brush cleaning glove and HOLY FRIGGIN' MOLY!!! It's next level stuff!<br /><br />It was so EASY to DEEPLY clean all my brushes in a FRACTION of my normal time. My dense brushes have never been this clean. It was an actual pleasure to wash them! Never thought I would ever say that.<br /><br />Do not get an imitation. I saw those & thought about saving some money but in the end bought this glove. They really designed this to actually do all the work for you AND save your hands & nails. It is well thought out.<br /><br />All the different areas have a very useful purpose that do all the work. You need all the different areas. The area where you shape your brush at the end actually also squeezes out all the excess water from even those dense SigMax brushes. They felt 50% dry right after washing! I'm sure they will dry faster than ever. The terry inner glove made the whole silicone glove experience really nice and cozy. Your hand is comfortable all during the washing & after. None of that sweaty, sticky feeling you can get with rubber gloves. My hand was completely dry even after about 30 brushes!<br /><br />I like this new design, with the 2 thumbs, because you can always use your dominant hand to hold the brush. With one thumb you would have to switch hands to use the other side of the glove. One side is for face/larger brushes & the other is for eye/smaller brushes.<br /><br />I use Dr. Bronner's Castile Liquid Soap in the Baby Mild formula. Get yourself a pump dispenser & mix half soap and half water in the dispenser. Having the pump helps speed along the washing process as you just pump the soap onto the center cleaning area of the glove. You never have to put down the brush you are cleaning. This also helps keep the brush aimed down helping you not get water running up into the ferrule by accident as you work.<br /><br />This glove also makes it easy to know, just by sight, when your brush is completely clean, soap foam is white, and completely rinsed, no foam comes out of your brush when swirled after rinsing.<br /><br />My brushes are thoroughly deep cleaned for the first time in ages. They look brand new!<br /><br />If you have a bunch of brushes or even if you don't have that many but have some of the big dense ones, think of this glove as an investment. It will help you preserve the life of your brushes and keep bacteria off your face, yuck.<br /><br />It is really well made and should last a really long time. They only thing I could see happening is replacing the inner glove as it is terry cloth.<br /><br />I LOVE this and will happily be washing my brushes all the time now. My face, hands & nails are all going to benefit.",1412893130000,True,26

There is a small plastic holder that covers just the blades themselves and a small part of the razor.  Very minimalist which is fine if that's what you want.

B07DH7T7NF,B07DH7T7NF,5.0,Im in LOVE with my mirror!! 😍,"Ive been wanting one of these mirrors for a while now. And im SO happy i finally found the Perfect one. Its light weight, and sleek looking. Everyone thinks i spent $100 or more on it! It has a good sturdy base. It was easy to put together. Just snap the base onto the neck of the mirror and your good to go. Came charged. The light has three levels of brightness. And the button to turn the light on and up, is conveniently placed on the back of the mirror towards the bottom. Its great placement in that it allows you to turn it on and adjust the lighting and angle with one hand, and without having to put your fingers on the mirror, leaving finger prints. The light that it puts off it amazinnng. Makes my skin look smoother then it really is! So its like having a filter on if you take a selfie in it. Not to mention the ring light makes your eyes look beautiful and doesnt leave shadows on your face so it helps with symmetrical application or plucking. No unblended foundation ever again with this mirror! 😁😁  I included a picture of my reflection, AFTER i peeled off the protective film that comes on the mirror with ""AMIRO"" written on it... to try and show just how crystal clear the mirror really is. It doesnt distort your reflection at all. Which is a huge plus,because many other similar products do. The charging cord is well made, you charge for an hour and it lasts an entire day! (Youd never need it to be on for 24s hours, so basically u charge it once, and it will last you well over a week before youd need to charge it again) ive had mine for about a week and a half and havnt had to charge it ever. Except just to try it n make sure everything worked. Ive used it every morning (about 15 mins) and at night (another 10/15 mins) plus at random times. So deff good battery life. It shipped and arrived fast. Seller was polite, quick to respond and helpful when answering my pre purchase questions as well. Im so happy i finally have one of these mirrors i see everywhere. And that i snagged it for a good price and it exceeded my expectations. Id give this product two thumbs up. Lol It would work perfect for both professionals and novices.",1549467357696,True,0

Disadvantages: a) Cleaning with tap water is clearly more tedious than for simpler shavers (like my old Philips). b) Doesn't bother me, might bother others: It is louder than other shavers. c) ""Hidden"" costs: 5 USD/month for the cleaning cardridges and from the 19th month of use on additional 2 USD/month for the replacement shaving unit when everything is used as recommended. But compare the high cost for Gilette Sensor blades plus foam! d) Pure cosmetics (but if you buy the Mercedes you want perfect design): The lowest bar indicating battery charge has a red frame, so red = bad. At the same time, the best bar for hygiene status has a red frame as well, so here red = optimum. Doesn't make sense. In addition the green LEDs on the cleaning station have some cross-talk.

However, there are many design issue made the installation process not pleasant.<br />2) The installation manual, as expected through preview, is horrible.  There are many key steps not clearly stated.  I have to figured them out myself and it took me long time to do so.<br />3) The design is not space saving.  The hardwares are behind the glass panels which demand space.  Although it claims to be standard 60X32.  The space inside the enclosure is much smaller than that because of the hardware behind the glass panels.  This, by the way, is not clearly explained, and I concerned about not having enough bathroom space to host it.  I had to put the frame up to understand that it requires 60X32 finished space to host the unit.  Essentially treat it like a washer/dryer.<br />4) The drainage design is not American standard, and I was told it's European.  The drainage pipe is only 1 1/2"" (American uses 2"" pipe) and no clear instruction in the menu on drainage hookup or choices of rough in preparation.  The flexible drainage pipe looks cheap and I am not sure how long it will last before leaking.<br /><br />I'll update you once the unit is finished and tested.  Oeverall, the price seems really attractive.  I recommend to have an experienced guy, which is hard to find, to put it together.<br /><br />The contractor just got the installation 95% done.

So I bought the Hairgurt Intense Repair Deep Conditioner in Almond honey.  Let me just tell you that it really does look edible!! And it smells edible!  It's not a strong smell and it leaves no trace of scent afterwards.  The texture is also that of food--it looks and feels like whipped butter.<br />But we don't buy this to eat it so how did my hair do? My hair did very well but not better than with other less costly products.  That is why this gets 4 stars instead of 5.  My hair is normally wavy but is not coarse.  Due to hair coloring as I mentioned, it had taken a beating and my wave actually diminished but my hair became coarser and very frizzy.  After using this hairgurt the first day, my hair did feel smooth afterward for the rest of the day.  It dried a bit frizzy but not much.  I do not blow dry my hair.  However, after going to bed at night, sleeping on cotton pillowcase, my hair was super coarse and frizzy the next day.  I did not give up.  I used the treatment for 3 more days but always with the same result. I've had better results with other treatments I bought at a local beauty supply store.  However the hairgurt DOES work, if only for the day.  Maybe it will be better with continued use and if I continue and get better results, I will then update my review.<br />Please ask any questions and I will do my best to answer. Thank you.",1475101027000,False,1

B0941YDPSW,B0941YDPSW,5.0,"Works great, strong scent","Have been using this bar for over a month now. I have fine, thinish hair. We have a whole house water softener system, otherwise we would have very hard water. Now with that out of the way, I love how the bar lathers up and cleans my hair. No residue and no need for a conditioner after. I rub the bar on my hands rather than directly onto my head, making sure I have lots of water in my hair so that the lather is evenly distributed throughout my hair. This method works very well for me. It rinses clean and leaves my hair feeling soft.<br />The only downside for me is the intensity of the scent. It is much too strong even though the site shows it to be low intensity.<br />My bar sits on a wire shelf at the back of my shower so it does dry out between uses; have not had it get mushy. I wash my hair every other day and my bar hardly shows any use so it should last quite some time.",1671036467094,True,5

So when I saw this was available at a discount for review, I decided to try it out.  This came in two short days with no shipping issues. When I received it, I couldn't believe how incredibly large the jar is.  It's huge! The first time I used it I could see how hydrating it was to my dried out split ends (which I need to get trimmed off).  I like to mix fractionated coconut oil with this treatment cream.  Natural coconut oil contains fatty acids that help to immerse each hair follicle with beneficial vitamins and minerals. When the oil is used with a scalp massage, the lauric acid in the oil help to shield the scalp from lice and dandruff which can inhibit hair growth and affect hair health.<br /><br />Using coconut oil for hair is one of the most natural ways to increase moisture in the hair shaft. When the hair is dry, the shaft becomes frayed and is easily damaged. Not only does this affect the health of the hair, but it also causes the hair to look frizzy, dried out and damaged.<br /><br />Those who use coconut oil for hair mask treatments find the fatty acids are able to bind with the proteins in their hair so the hair is sealed with protection, trapping in the moisture and making the hair soft, silky and shiny.  This works out for me because I get Brazilian Blowouts on my hair and have plenty of proteins for it to bind to.<br /><br />I couldn't quite tell what the ingredients are exactly in this as I don't recognize them as being something &#34;whole&#34; or natural.  That worries me a bit, but it does work great when I mix it with my coconut oil and it keeps my hair soft and smooth without being weighed down.",1464887167000,False,0

It is heavier built and<br />should last.  It also has a place in the back for those who<br />have the stand.  We do not.  All eyes have lashes on them already<br />just like real eyes.

I watched a video wear this girl rubbed a lime on her armpit to get rid of odors, and then I switched to Schmidt's stick deoderant , with bergamot and lime essential oils.

B096KHWMYX,B096KHWMYX,5.0,"Works well, easy to use, one drawback is tricky to take apart and put back together for cleaning","We purchased Pet Electric Hair Clipper: professional tools for your love pets/grooming clipper, from Caleegi.<br /><br />Everything appears to be quite well made, of sturdy construction. The scissors and nail trimmers came out of the box sharp, and have a good weight to them. The nail trimmers have a good locking mechanism, metal, not plastic; I think it will last. The set comes with a convenient little storage pouch, which I hadn't noticed on the item description specs list. I like the colors of the pouch. They're cute. The pouch easily fits everything in the kit, except the brush. You can make the brush fit, but I dont think you can make the brush and electric clippers fit. I couldn't. The electric clippers come with a usb powered charger cord, but not a charger block. This is not a standard charger. If you lose this charge cord, you may be hard pressed to find a replacement.<br /><br />The brush is of good construction, and the ergonomic handle grip is a joy to hold. For real, it just feels good in your hand. I like the push button hair dislodger for easy brush cleaning. Our dog is fairly short haired, straight and wirey, and our cat is fluffy but on the short side of medium length hair. It took very little hair off them, and I haven't found a product better than the Furminator for brushing them. But I've had and worked with longer haired dogs, and for a Great Pyrenees, Burnese Mountain Dog, or Saint Bernard, I think this would be the perfect brush.<br /><br />The nail file worked great. The comb I intend to keep for myself- it's perfect for my wiry, sometimes wavy, sometimes curly, always disobedient hair.<br /><br />The electric clipper charged fairly quickly, enough that I could take it for a test spin about 15-20 minutes after plugging it in. I love the electronic digital display, showing how far along in its charging it is, and the RPMs of the clipper blades. I love that it came with a little bottle of lubricant solution for the blades (none of my personal trimmers ever have). The little obligatory cleaning brush to sweep between the blades looks much the same that any electric trimmer does, but I found it shed a wire or two with every pass throughthe blades, which my personal trimmer brushes do not.<br /><br />I tried the electric clippers out on myself first. I was a little bummed that the nearly universal gaurds that come with clippers designed for people did not fit. The clippers are much more quiet then most clippers, which is good for not startling pets. I used the clippers with the guard on the sides of my head and with no gaurd to shave my face. It went easily through my hair, had no trouble, and gave me a close, even shave. And I went a little rough to see if there was any danger of maybe cutting a squirming or struggling pet, and it seems very safe.<br /><br />The clipper blades came off pretty easy for cleaning, but were kind of tricky to put back on, and in trying to do so, I hit at a funny angle and the entire clipper assembly fell apart in to 4 pieces. That was annoying, but after messing around with it for about a half hour, I was able to put it back together, and it still worked fine. I would be hesitant to take it apart for cleaning again, though I'm sure I will. Despite this one design flaw, I still think overall this is a pretty quality product.",1628187040581,True,1

Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this was the best thing. I like the quick 1-hour charge a lot.  The shaving time is actually shortened for me because I just do it during the shower.  Nevertheless, the shaver at $120 is not cheap.  Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast.  But I found a remedy- Nivea ""after shave balm"" 3.3 oz. at $4.79 in a local CVS pharmacy or Walmart gives you the same quality  as little five Nivea 0.4 oz. cartridges(total 2 oz.) at $5 do.

B075SXRXKP,B075SXRXKP,3.0,A little flimsy for multiple 8 inch Jo Jo bows.,"My 7yr old, and I were so excited to get these to hold her many, many large Jo Jo Siwa bows. I was expecting the ribbon to be a little thicker, and longer. It holds 4 large 8 inch bows comfortably. Possibly 5, however because the ribbon is really thin, it doesn't hang straight when holding, organizing, or using. The ribbon twists around, and doesn't hang straight at all. There just isn't enough space for what we need either. I think these would be great for smaller bows, tho. They look just as pictured. I'm just now learning about the different types of ribbon out there to hold the larger bows more stable. I have not found or purchased a new set, yet. I think if these were longer, it might not have been a complete miss for what I was looking for. The set with the crowns and the ribbon rings as the hooks, do fit over my daughter's dresser draw knobs, which I was hoping, and looking for when ordering. I'm still giving them a 3 star review, because they would be nice for other's needs as I've mentioned. A suggestion would be to make much longer ones. Another foot or 2, and possibly use a heavier ribbon material.<br /><br />I'm not upset with the product itself, as much as I am upset that I didn't realize that these are not ideal for a lot of large bows.

B000LCETUO,B000LCETUO,5.0,A Cheap But Effective Attractant!,"I have to say I am pleasantly surprised! This simple little mixture of only 5 bucks is actually effective! I received it yesterday and took it out for a test run today for work. I work in a retail chain store so I communicate with many people every day and I got hit after hit after hit.<br /><br />My intent in wearing this was to evoke a warm and friendly persona which I radiate naturally but because this is a store, customers can be a tad dismissive to employees. So I applied my Pure Instinct to the sides of my collarbone, behind my ears, the veins on my wrist, and various dabs on my clothes so the smell can last a little longer. What a sweet and pleasant smell it has! It smells a tad like melon and bubble gum. A little powder too. Smells delicious! Despite these sweet scents, it doesn't smell ""kiddie"" and ""immature"" and plus the smell is light and could never be overpowering. It's quite the flattering scent that you could wear alone or compliment with your own signature perfume. Also the actual pheremone count in the bottle does seem to be a bit low (which is not a problem) so you cannot overdose on the pheremones and get bad effects. It's waaay too hard to overdose so dab as much as you feel is necessary on yourself. ^^<br /><br />From the moment my shift started, customers actually stopped and listened when I offered them my help and advice. They would take my bags and even passing customers would come up just to compliment me and tell me kind things. This is definitely a unisex attractant because both genders were equally affected in positive ways and made my job very fruitful today! This is the perfect pheremone mixture to use at work if you're looking for a pheremone for the work place!<br /><br />Many times customers would pass me by, stop, and exclaim that I smell wonderful and ask what I was wearing. A couple of guys came to me just to talk about how delicious I smelled, haha! Because I was having such great and magnetic success at my job, my managers were constantly praising me with excitement and even the DISTRICT MANAGER who stopped by to check on our store was highly impressed by my energy and how attracted to me the customers were.<br /><br />The smell does lessen after about 4 hours and I was not able to smell it anymore unless I really sniffed myself but it seems others could still smell it because I was still being complimented on my scent. Not bad! I reapplied on my break just for extra safety though, hehe!<br /><br />This has been a highly successful test run and I will be wearing this lovely magic in a bottle quite often! &lt;3",1359529251000,True,5

It's not difficult to break the beads. I just press on them and they rub into the skin. After applying the serum, my face was really dry. I have been using this at night. I have a multi-step skin care routine so I followed this with my nighttime moisturizer, then retinol, and some face oil. The serum doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.

I purchase directly at the gnc store, but I notice amazon is selling for less money, so next time I need a refill I'll try purchasing from here. I've tried others brands of rhodiola trying to save a few bucks (I.e. vitamin shoppe) and nothing comes close to the gnc brand. It's the best! I take one a day first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and that does the trick. I've never experienced any negative side effects. I personally wouldn't take it past noon because I wouldn't want it to effect my peaceful nights rest. You get a slight energy buzz. Nothing drastic though. I've read people complain of rapid heartbeat or anxiety, but I've never experienced anything like that and I'm super sensitive to caffeine and all stimulants, but this is nothing like those (doesn't contain caffeine). It gives me a blissful, energetic feeling. My husband is thankful for them too because I'm nicer to him when I take it :-) I've also noticed it helps regulate my menstrual cycles and pms symptoms. It is also reported to help with fertility problems. All around a great herbal supplement. Very effective!",1388341094000,False,11

This review is for: [SKIN&LAB] Barrierderm Milky Serum | Infused with Milk Ceramide Complex, Squalane, and Panthenol to ...<br /><br />I have used products from Skin & Lab before and liked most of them, and this serum is no exception. I was coming off of a different moisturizer that really irritated my skin, so I introduced this serum slowly. I started using it only once a day and once that previous irritation cleared up I moved up to twice a day.<br /><br />This serum is somewhere in between watery and a cream. The glass bottle is opaque and the serum does dispense as  milky-looking. It has no scent that I can detect. The dropper dispenses enough for about half my face, so I've been using two droppers per application. It has soothed my skin, clearing up my previous Rosacea break out and smoothing out my skin. I have an oily t-zone and a super dry chin this winter,  and all of that seems to be gone now.<br /><br />Due to these cold, breezy winter months, I have been using a moisturizer over this serum. I suspect that in the summer months, I might not even need to do that.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to continued use of this product and when it's gone I will most likely buy more.

I had to shake the bottle several times and even then it would not come out of the dropper freely. I didn't like that. I will not be buying it again.

I tried that, but my face felt too dry, so I moistened it a little bit and then applied the gel. I rinsed it off well and patted my skin dry. Within seconds I felt my skin drying up. If you have really dry skin, you know what I mean - that taut feeling you try to avoid. I had to get some cream and moisturize right away. I'm guessing there must be something like alcohol in this makeup remover. If you have oily skin or perhaps you're trying to remove a heavy foundation - this may be a good choice for you.

I purchased a few different colors. They all covered well and lasted a long time without chipping much. I liked this color best because of the faint metallic hint to the finish. It allowed the nail fungus to grow out and my other nails were never affected. Thank you for making a safe and high quality product! I even told the people at my local salon so they can recommend it to other clients if needed and maybe even offer it.,1623527876502,True,0

B01GBZT5GM,B01GBZT5GM,5.0,No greasy feel!!,"I’ve tried Skederm products and I really like all of them. This one was no exception because I think it works really well. The main purpose is to form a protective barrier to keep moisture locked into the skin to keep it hydrated.<br /><br />FEEL: It is not greasy, which I am always concerned about when I buy a moisturizer. Instead it feels almost like a satin finish, almost like a primer. It can be worn under makeup as well. It does keep my face moisturized without that greasy, oily feeling and look.<br /><br />BENEFITS: This is more of a prevention cream than anything to repair. It will help maintain the skin’s elasticity and prevent wrinkles and sagging. This is because as we age, the skin loses elasticity due to a loss of collagen and moisture. This also has macadamia nut oil for antioxidant purposes, which is so important in a moisturizer. This prevents cellular aging.<br /><br />MY EXPERIENCE: I have combination skin. It is oily in some areas and dry in others. I put this on the dryer areas to even out my skin, which has worked really well. I leave it off my nose, which tends to get oily. I had very oily skin in my younger years and I think that this would have worked well for that because it is not really a typical moisturizer.

However, without a top coat these are going to come off extremely quickly (plus, the instructions call for using a top coat), so with that in mind, you WILL obviously have some drying time. It is handy that they come with a file and cuticle stick which can be used to help put them in place. It takes a delicate manner to get these peeled and placed without messing them up or having air bubbles. I have seen both better and worse products which is why this set is getting 3 stars from me. I would consider them about middle of the road for this type of product. At the stated &#34;sale&#34; price of $4.99 I would consider them a decent buy. They are super cute and fun for a few days.

You can typically get the job done with 3 bundles (especially if the hair is under 20""). In regards to the hair quality, we all know this is Chinese hair. It's silky straight that's been steamed to create waves. I don't forsee it getting tangled and the closure is passable. The hair does have a slight red tint to it and you can identify red strands of ""hair"" throughout all the bundles so at least that's consistent o__o. You get what you pay for. And yes there's a chemical smell.<br />Would I buy this hair again? NO! Would I install it again? NO",1568802714463,True,8

After a short trial, I have to say that I am getting a noticeably closer shave.  It should be noted that I am a fair skinned blondish guy, so I do not have a five o'clock shadow to contend with.  What I don't care for are:  1 - surprisingly large shaver, 2 - all hard plastic angles, quite a change from the more compact and rounded Norelco, and 3 - the shaving heads are spread far apart compared to the Norelco where the heads are all tightly central.

B000PKNPES,B000PKNPES,2.0,I had to try it for myself.,"After reading all of the bad reviews on this new Norelco shaver, I swore I was not going to buy this unit.<br /><br />Well, a few months ago I realized my local stores didn't stock my HQ5 Norelco replacement blades anymore and I about had a heart attack. Oh, darn, I am now being forced to upgrade and I was quite happy with my current shaver.<br /><br />I have had a Norelco 5885XL for the past 13 years. I love this unit and it suits me well. This only noteworthy things about this old unit is that I have had to have the batteries replaced only two times, but this is normal since they wear out every 6 years or so.<br /><br />Here is my 1050x review.. it was painful to write, but here goes..<br /><br />--This is a noisy shaver folks.. I graduated to a 5885XL a long time ago and was surprised of the whisper quiet shave it delivered.  The 1050x is about 2-3 time noisier than my 15 year old Norelco, WTH? This is not good. I simply cannot accept a noisy shaver. This thing is inches away from my ears at 5am and that is very annoying. I need peace and quiet at those early hours, and this would not work long term.<br /><br />--What a bad shave. Starting with a 2-day shadow growth, I shaved half of my face with my trusty 5885XL [using 1.5 year old blades] and the other half with my shiny new 1050x unit. I actually had my wife feel both shaves afterwords to confirm I wasn't being overly critical of my new toy.<br /><br />As I suspected, she confirmed my 5885xl produced a better shave, in about the same amount of time.<br /><br />As I shaved with the 1050x, I realized that I was going over the same growth areas without making things smoother, especially around the neck.  I was getting tired, frustrated, and irritated. The pivoting head technology is clearly inferior to Norelcos older units.<br /><br />--Here come the skin irritations: Ahhh!!!<br />Just a few minutes after my shave test had ended, my 1050x side was now irritated and not feeling comfortable [like my 5885xl side was]. Having used Norelcos all of my shaving life, about 25 years, this irritation I feel is not normal, and I do not find this acceptable; even if there is a break-in period; not for me there isn't. no thanks..<br /><br />--Bad charging system!  What the heck is it with this terrible charging system. I should be able to plug the unit in directly and not have to lug around more junk to lose or break while on travel. The AC adapter cable does not even fit into the travel case, how stupid is that!?! I can see this cable being the 1st thing I lose on a business trip because it does not have a place to be stored.<br /><br />Gosh, I wanted to love using this shaver. I was excited and wanted to prove all these other bad reviews wrong. Sadly, they are correct in every way.<br /><br />My guess is many of the good reviews are being written by persons who have not had the pleasure of trying one of Norelco's older shavers to notice the amazing quality they can provide. Folks, do yourself a favor and get an older model, preferably something from the late 90's IMHO.<br /><br />Norelco, come'on buddy.. Your losing me big time here.<br /><br />It's back to my 5885xl, and I have found my HQ5's here on Amazon, clicking buy; and it's byebye to my 1050x.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />F.",1245568562000,False,0

Can I say it is addictive? Yes, I guess it does have a banana scent and the texture is similar to a banana cream pie topped with whipped cream.<br /><br />To say this is decadent is an understatement. You will be very tempted to slather your entire body in a good helping of this cream. Fortunately, it goes a long way and absorbs extremely well. In fact, that is why they call it ""vanishing"" crème. The ingredient list is impressive and contains rose water, mango butter, beeswax, grapeseed oil, rosehip seed oil, Vitamin E, marshmallow extract, willowbark extract, calendula flower extract, and a heady fragrance.<br /><br />Grapeseed oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants and is high in proanthocyanidins, a group of bioflavonoids that are superior because they are water soluble. This ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure.<br /><br />""Marsh Mallow"" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows. It has been used for centuries as a food and a medicine. The leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with healing properties for inflamed skin. In the past, people boiled the roots in wine to make a cough remedy.<br /><br />I found this luscious creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind. Not only will you feel comforted by nature, your skin will be baby soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing. The silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal. If you love this product, you might want to try the Pore-refining mask, Evening Primrose Overnight Crème and the very unique parsley blemish stick. To take luxury to the next level, try the Shea Butter Decollete Crème on your feet, hands or all over your entire body. What an amazing line of products. They heal, protect and soothe your mind.<br /><br />I'm still trying all the Burt's Bees products, and love how these products make me feel.

B000EQYYNO,B000EQYYNO,4.0,bulbs are cheap,"Sent it back because you can't get a non-broken lightbulb?  That's pretty silly, the cost of shipping it back was probably more than the cost to go to the hardware store and buy a $.75 bulb.  I agree that they did a poor job of shipping the replacement, but you will break or burn-out the bulbs eventually anyway...  So suck it up and go buy a bulb.<br /><br />And for the reviewer complaining about the focal distance...  The magnification rate and focal legnth are tied together by the laws that govern the optical properties of a magnifying lense.  Any simple single element lense of the same power will have the same focal distance.  You need a binocular or telescope to magnify with this sort of power at a longer distance, that means more weight, and compound lenses.  They do make such devices, microsurgeons have them, and people with really poor eyesight sometimes need them.  Another option is to tell an eyedoctor what you want and get a perscription for some progressive lenses with a variable focal legnth... but magnification will drop off quickly as objects are farther out, after all this is another simple single element lense again.<br /><br />This unit does what it is supposed to do, though the headlights are kinda crappy with regard to their aim...  But you can get the bulbs to aim better if you adjust them a bit, or use different bulbs that have a wider dispersion pattern... or just turn them off and use a good worklight.",1229838006000,True,2

Silk is the best way to maintain waves because they don't pull the hairs out of place like stocking caps (pro tip).

I thought it might have been a leak, and sure enough the product had sticky goo all over the cardboard packaging. It was pretty bad even for a leak, so I examined it over the sink, but then realized the ENTIRE top half of the spirit gum adhesive bottle had broken off and half the glue was filling the clear plastic cover attached to the cardboard.<br /><br />At this point I was worried about glass cuts but I tried to salvage what remained of the glue. Using a scissor, I tried extracting the glue remover so at least I can use it to clean up all the stickiness resulting from the sticky situation. When I cut the packaging open, all the glue started dripping out into the sink.  Long story short, the glue got everywhere and it was a mess cleaning up because THE REMOVER DIDN'T WORK EITHER!  As there was a lot of glue, I also applied the remover liberally, including pouring out enough to cover my hand and soaking a cloth to scrape with.  I had to later resort to using citric acid using lemons and that seemed to work better but still tough to remove.<br /><br />I considered buying a new one but at that point I really didn't think it was worth it given my experience. All in all it took maybe 2 hours to clean up, and to begin with I have an extreme dislike for sticky substances on my hands.",1498355533570,True,0

I had to cut off a bunch of hair after a bleach accident, and I HATE having short hair, so I've been curling it just to make it a little less awful. I obviously don't want to use heat when I'm trying to nurse my hair back to health, so my only real option is sleeping in curlers. Foam rods make great curls, but they are horribly uncomfortable, and my hair is too slippery for rag curlers when it's this short. These looked like a happy medium.<br /><br />These are pretty easy to use - they roll well, and the wires keep them in place pretty well. They are much, much more comfortable to sleep in than foam rods. I understand that they have to be squishy to be comfortable; however they are just too small! I tried them every night for two weeks, and I never got the curls I wanted. They almost always ended up much too tight, except when I tried rolling larger sections, which ended up really uneven - tight in places and barely curled in others. I'm going for a defined curl, not soft waves, but these were ridiculous.<br /><br />I ended up removing the foam and replacing it with cut-up foam rods, which was a slight improvement over just the foam rods. I'm currently testing (second night) foam rods that are very big but made of super squishy, comfortable foam. If they don't work, I'll go back to the hybrid of these and fosm rods til I find something better, do they aren't totally worthless, but I wouldn't buy them again.",1488437285000,True,4

It looks good out of the package but smelled so bad-musty dusty backend dragged in dirt and stired in a garbage can for too many days.  Delivery was late, first 2 boxes 2 days late, 3rd box 3 days late and the fourth box 5 days late.  Had an event-I was replacing the tape ins i currenky had in with what was supposed to be Silky Smooth Remy new - 3 of the boxes made it to me with 2 hours before I had to leave and i had already removed my other tape ins so i had to put these in.  No time to wash them and my boyfriend almost barfed at the smell so dryer sheets to the rescue-rubbed them all thru out the hair and them perfume masked mist of the stench.  Thank the universe the maker must coat the hair with silicone or some other sealant because there was no time to do anything like styling-braided it fir the car ride to add a little wave.  So i waited 2 days before i washed my hair so the tapes were set (i will great tapes are used-these puppies dont slide or come apart) i wet the hair and it felt like wire and I knew i was going to be fumed.  Washed very gently and applied deep conditioner snd prayed.  Ribsed conditioner afer 5 min and felt no better.  Put in bonding conditioner-rinsed no better.  Absorbed as much water out of hair and put in a leave and tried to comb thru with a wide tooth, no joke 45 min to comb thru-but the hair just went on Frizz and retangled.  5 different hair oroducts later, wore in a braid overnite and all day today.  It looks ok but still feels like wire.  I an so sad and pissed - I spent 2 days shopping for this hair-my budget was smaller so i knew the hair wouldn’t be the quality I usually get ( I always bought from Bombshell at $150 for 20 pieces). I always buy 3-4 packs of tape ins, but I honestly think someone detailed a horse or this hair belonged to a nappie headed dirty ho who is now dirty bald ho.  Look at the pics, that is an unused piece-i wet it all but 3/4 to the tape, put deep conditiiner on it, rinsed and let it air dry-not a damn thing silky, smooth about.  Each piece is made up of hair strands from 2inches to 24 inches long -all different lengths-i had one piece half was 24 inches and the other half if the same piece was 2-4 inches.

The video shows perfectly how easily my nail polish came off. The nail polish I used to remove actually has glitter in it. Most of the time glitter nail polish is very hard to remove . Once I was getting a pedicure and the gal told me I shouldn't use glitter polish which I love using cause it's to hard to remove! Can you believe her ! Well I know she wasn't using Pure Body Naturals Nail Polish Remover !<br /><br />I'm totally amazed at this Nail Polish Remover for several reasons:<br /><br />1. The smell ( I hate the smell of Acetone ) it just has a very mild hint of scent just barely can smell it !<br /><br />2. It's No acetone !!!!! Acetone is highly flammable<br /><br />3. No acetate<br /><br />4. No ethyl lactate<br /><br />5. 100% biodegradable !!!!!!!<br /><br />6. It's Made in the USA !!!!!!<br /><br />This Nail polish remover is a plant-based remover . It does not evaporate like those stinky acetone removers. It stays on the nail it's oily so therefore it moisturizers the nail bed and cuticle . 100% Natural earth friendly Product ! It is Naturally deprived from farm crops and does not contain any petroleum ingredients . Has I removed the nail polish using this 100% natural nail polish remover I noticed how oil it was . I could not believe how easily it removed the polish ! I am totally amazed at the results ! I literally can not stand the smell of the other brands that are not Natural !<br /><br />This bottle of Natural remover is a nice 4oz. Fluid or 120 ml bootle . It comes with a long eye dropper for easy application on a cotton ball . Once I put this natural recover on the cotton all it removed all the nail polish I didn't have to keep adding the remover . It does not evaporate .<br /><br />The video is worth a thousand words ! The directions state that I should put the nail polish directly on the polished nail . I can only upload one video so I choose to put this video on. I did do it as the directions stated as well as putting it on a cotton ball like in the video . Both works great ! I like putting it on the cotton ball simply cause that's what I'm use to doing . When I put it directly on the nail I only waited one minute and the nail polish wiped right off !!!!!!<br /><br />Fantastic Nail Polish Remover !<br /><br />I received this Pure Body Naturals 100% Natural Nail Polish Remover for Free in trade of a Honest and Unbiased Review .,1460213214000,False,0

B000UJZIEY,B000UJZIEY,5.0,Best electric razor I have owned.,"I have always had a problem with electric razors. Electric razors never seem to get close enough and usually cause me to break out in a rash. So far I have been extremely impressed with this razor. The shave is very close and I don't have problems with skin irritation. Plus it is easy to clean. I lather my face with soap pre-shave which helps cut back on the amount of nivea lotion I need to use. The only downside on mine is that the refill station does not appear to work. This is not a big deal though as you can fill it manually with the nivea lotion bottle. Also it comes with a smaller travel charger base which I prefer anyways as the refill station is enormous and takes up too much counter space. As other reviewers have pointed out this is really not a razor to use in the car. It is meant to be used wet and with the Nivea lotion since when used without hair clippings will go everywhere. I found when using soap and the lotion I do not have a problem with clippings. In the manual on page 22 it states: ""This razor has no hair collection chamber to capture stubble. To prevent stubble from falling, apply sufficient shaving conditioner while shaving."" If you don't intend to use moisturizer with this system then you would probably be better off buying a product that is not designed for it. So far though I love the product and it is one of the closest shaves I ever had. On a side note I only paid $109 when I purchased mine. The current price I think is a little high. Awesome product highly recommend it!",1265234535000,False,1
B00EEN2HCS,B0BM4GX6TT,5.0,LOVE IT (not a sponsored review),I use this approximately once every two weeks. I think its great! Easy to set up & put away.<br /><br />Note for use: Do NOT over-draw the area to be dyed because it dyes the skin & you will look crazy like caterpillar eyes for a few days until it lifts from washing. I use the included wedged brush to draw my eyebrow EXACTLY how I would when applying my makeup & the result is perfect. It works so fast that once i finish the eyebrow i wait only 10 seconds and immediately take a wet face cloth and wipe it off. You can use remaining dye in the cup to re-apply if its not dark enough for you. Its very simple!<br /><br />The dye only lasts on skin for around 3 days but the hair of your eyebrow stays dyed for a little over a week. Honestly the whole process takes no more than 10 mins so its fine to do it weekly in your routine.,1456391473000,True,2

It helps to take care of those stains that we all get from coffee, tea or soda. I absolutely love how small and easy to carry, the pen is. You can just throw it in your bag and go. It comes in a long metal silver tube with a twist and click bottom. It gives the appearance of being a very high quality product. The tube kind of reminds me of a skinny mascara tube.  The gel is easy to apply with the included brush and as it states in the instructions you do want to try to not get it on your gums to avoid any sensitivity or irritation. The only drawback is, it is not the best tasting stuff, but none of these types of products that I have used are.

They came quickly and are really wonderful quality hair. They are super soft and come with everything you need to put them in yourself-the hair pieces, tapes and a comb. I watched a few youtube videos to make sure I wouldn't screw it up. I wanted to add them just to the sides of my head, where I'm thinnest to see how I liked using/wearing them.  The application was super easy.  I am so surprised how easy this is to do yourself at least on the sides of your head. The back of the head will be a challenge but have a friend help you out. These also come with additional adhesive in case of any mistakes. There are only 20 pieces which create 10 hair pieces because you sandwich your hair between two loose hair pieces.

B088FLBYWT,B088FLBYWT,3.0,Great...BUT Beware of Size Issues,"EDIT - I wrote the review below and then I realized that each page has it's specific style AND varied SIZES.  I didn't realize this at first.  This fact alone will lead me to not buy them again.  It's common to mess up on ONE brow in a pair.  Its nice to be able to go to your page and just cut off a new one and not worry if it's the same size as the others.  I only like the bigger (longer) brows, so I won't even want to use half the brows on each page.  Major issue for me.  I'll leave the tips below, because if you don't care about size differences, maybe this info will help you.<br /><br />1-  They are overall amazing!<br />2-  They take some practice, but it's worth it.<br />3-  When I mess up, I remove them with alcohol and toilet tissue.  I wet it with alcohol and rub with dry toilet tissue.  The dry helps rub the transfer off.  It's not super pleasant, but it works.<br />5-  They last for me for two full days.<br />6-  As crazy as it sounds, I followed the advice of someone here and shaved my (small) brows after trying to apply over my natural brows.  I was very freaked out about shaving my brows, but my brows sucked anyhow and it improved the look of these by far!<br />7-  My advice is to try all or almost all of the varieties sent in the package.  It can't hurt to try, right?!  Remember you can always remove them if you really can't stand them. Some of the ones that looked very odd on paper, looked not bad on me!  Some look better on ""natural"" days and some look better with make-up.  I wear the ones I don't hate on days I'm just staying home and I save my favs for the days I go out.<br />8-  The eyebrow print is on the front AND the back, so you can hold them up in the mirror to place correctly.  Super helpful.<br />9-  Again, overall these look very natural!  To eliminate the shiny look they can have a little brush of power foundation works, but I have found that a little water splashed on my face after helps too.",1599447669377,True,1

Formulations were similar, all using several types of natural oils to create a moisturizing product.  Two things convinced me to try Beardsmen.  First, the quantity.  For less money than some other products, Beardsmen offers a much larger quantity of oil than pretty much anyone, so they definitely win the &#34;bang for the buck&#34; award.  Second, Beardsmen is the only one that has a flow controlling dispenser, so you don't have to mess with ridiculous eye droppers and such.  Oh... and the product itself?  I LOVE it.  No more flaky chin skin, and my beard is soft and smooth.  This is obviously a plus as far as my wife is concerned.  There is only the very slightest hint of a light &#34;oil&#34; smell when you first put it on, which is not strong enough be more than barely noticeable for a second or two, and definitely would never be noticed by others.  After using this for about a month, and giving a small quantity to a friend to try, I still have most of the bottle full.  This stuff will last forever, and when you finally do run out, you'll likely panic and jump on Amazon to get another bottle.  I know I will.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After a little thought, I tried a small experiment, that worked out well.  I carefully pried the dispenser plug out of the bottle and put a few drops of my favorite cologne into the unscented beard oil, then replaced the plug.  Now I have this great beard oil that smells very nice as well.",1455609868000,True,3

It's a really short cord so you need to sit really close to a wall switch.<br /><br />Overall it's a great starter kit especially for the price so I'm satisfied and look forward to using the product.

That is why I requested this one. This review is of: Spanature Aloe Vera Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection Made In Korea 75 ml/2.53oz (4pcs)…<br /><br />As the product information states, this comes as four cute boxes of lotion, great for gift giving. Inside the boxes, all four tubes of lotion do have foil caps, so your safety was considered.<br /><br />The lotion itself smells light and airy to me, not heavy. It's also not very thick, and for that reason I do not like it as a hand lotion. I'm washing my hands all the time and I really need something thick to really moisturize and coat my hands. However, for a body that's been in the sun and/or water, this lotion is absolutely perfect and quite effective. It's a bit thin as I said, but it absorbs quickly and seems to last for at least 3-4 hours. (I am talking really dry skin here, so for you, it would probably last longer.)<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this Spanature Lotion.

They really do great lashes.<br /><br />(For reference, I got the medium multi-style pack, which I love because I can change my look each day. The more dramatic lashes are a bit heavy, but overall, they are non-existent on my face.  I can reuse them a few times, but they’re cheap enough for me to buy so I don’t really waste time washing and cleaning them, but I’m sure if you have that kind of patience, you could get 5-6 wears out of them.)",1616941912356,True,13

The eyeliner also is very water and smudge proof!<br /><br />I have only taken one star off because the lash band itself can be a little bit irritating for people with small eyelids/monolids. While wearing these lashes, the inner corner of my eyes were feeling a bit irritated because the band was poking the skin.

B00TQFL42I,B00TQFL42I,5.0,"Natural look, natural product","I purchased this from Carbon Beauty when it was sold out online at Sephora. I have tried many different brow products, including Anastasia, and find EcoBrow delivers the most natural appearing, long-lasting results. It's easy to build your brow to the color depth and shape that suits you. Any mistakes are easily corrected with a damp Q-tip. It lasts throughout the day, no touch-ups needed.<br /><br />The pot of color seems very small at first. But so little is used that I expect this to last a long time.<br /><br />A word about application. I also purchased the EcoBrow defining brush. I would recommend its purchase as well. The brush tip is firm, which makes application more precise, and the spoolie does not bend. I have a brow brush from Lancôme. It is softer and didn't give the control that the defining brush did.<br /><br />A word about color. The color swatches are deceiving since the pot of creme is so concentrated. Do pay attention to the hair color description provided. I did not, and first purchased Sharon.  This was a bit too light with a red undertone, not quite right for my dark brown hair. I then paid attention and purchased Liz. She was a perfect match for my dark brown hair.",1467062310000,True,4

The strange thing about it is that the bottom of the base has some kind of brown paper on it - it looks like it should be removable, but it’s not. Honestly, since I’ll be keeping scrunchies on this pretty much all the time this will likely remain covered, but I still don’t like it. I would also like it better if the diameter of the tube was slightly smaller so some of my ties that are slightly smaller don’t get stretched out, but I can work with this. I’m very happy it fits perfectly on my bookcase where I wanted it to go, and I also really love that even though it’s only $10, it comes with eight scrunchies to get you started. I’ve been using one of these scrunchies all week and so far it’s holding up well - while I thought I wouldn’t like the material, it actually feels way nicer than it looks. I’m very happy with this product and am considering getting more as gifts for others later this year, if it holds up.

B01258J0I2,B01258J0I2,4.0,Ivory colored shea butter with a smoky scent,Body Wonders Shea Butter 16 Fl Oz sates it’s 100% pure and virgin. The main name on the label is Organic Shea Butter. The color is a light ovoty and the scent is typical of shea butter. What the bottle doesn’t have and I would have preferred to see is a logo denoting the ‘organic’ certifaction. The back of the label states it’s from Ghana and has not been tested on animals. I think for the price it’s not a bad deal and I like that it comes in a tub. I would have prefeered it to be safety sealed especially since it came with a broken lid. The product appeared to be fine inside. On top of the jat there is also and expiration date of 12/22/18 for Lot 1222BW-sb.<br /><br />I am a big fan of shea butter and use it daily after my shower. It helps to keep my skin moisturized and and I love the smoky and nutty scent. If you are looking for authentic shes butter this is it…if you are looking for a lotion with shea butter that doesn’t have a strong scent you may not like this. The jar weighs in at 1 pound and 7/8 with the lid off so you are getting a pound of goodness. I have purchasedother products that have been short so I started weighing my products.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I do not guarantee 5 star reviews unless the product is one I would buy again and/or recommend to friends.

The printing paper is clearly labeled for which side to print. The adhesive sheets are separate.<br /><br />I did get the shiny decal look when I first put on the tattoo, but, by next morning, the tattoo had settled into the skin and looked terrific. I recommend applying the tattoo the day before you need it. It will look more natural by then. My current one has lasted a week so far. I am very pleased. I also used this product to put a decal on my laptop. It looks really nice.<br /><br />When applying the adhesive sheet, peel back only the top 1-2 inches, and align it with the top of the printed page. rup back and forth with your hand and slowly work to the other end. This will help reduce the amount of bubbling you get.

B01ETURI1K,B01ETURI1K,3.0,Good for what you pay for,"I like to fashion myself as sort of a cologne connoisseur…….a man’s man who just really likes to smell good all the time. I began wearing cologne shortly after I started my first job in high school, and ever since then I have been enamored with finding great smelling colognes. When I saw this cologne, and I read what it was inspired by, I felt that it was almost a must have for me.<br /><br />The first and most obvious reason most of us on here purchased this cologne is because it is inspired by Ralph Lauren Polo Red; and since that cologne is fairly pricey, undoubtedly most of us felt they were going to get a sweet deal. Now, you may ask what is the difference between this and the legitimate cologne that you would pay 60$ or more for?<br /><br />The first thing to know is that this cologne does not smell exactly like Polo Red at all. In fact, it is very loosely inspired by the actual scent. I challenge anyone to buy and smell the original cologne, then buy and smell this and tell me it’s exactly the same thing. Sorry folks, this just isn’t the same smell. It does, however, share similarities with the Polo Red…..which makes it enticing, but it just is not the same thing.<br /><br />The main issue that I have with this cologne is that it simply does not last more than an hour at best. I now understand why you get a 3.0-ounce bottle for 15$, and that is because you are constantly reapplying it to keep the smell fresh. With a normal (and quality) cologne I can go pretty much the extent of my eight-hour shift at work and still smell relatively fresh, but this cologne honestly started fading at about 20-30 minutes after application.<br /><br />In the end this may not bother folks who just want something cheap to make them smell good for a little while. Heck, even I like the way it smells at first. The problem for those of us who fashion ourselves fragrance snobs is that the scent just fades away too quickly.<br /><br />If affordability is what you look for in a cologne, then by all means this is your product. I, however, would just suggest spending the extra couple of bucks and buying the real deal. I can’t see how anyone would be disappointed with that at all.",1488132035000,True,3

B09NVT7GGD,B09NVT7GGD,4.0,Ejection system works well but times are actually too long for long haired cats.,"So I have a cat which is probably classified as a Norwegian forest cat breed with very long hair. And I really need to comb him to ensure I can get whatever hair he sheds to control hairballs. This brush does do a fairly good job but with my cat specifically the problem is that the tines are all bent in one direction.  Because of this you have to draw the brush downward on the cat in a smooth motion where the handle is always oriented downward in a line with your stroke.  By that I mean you can't hold the brush sideways or you can't pull the brush upside down and just use it any direction you want you must always draw the brush downward in direction consistent with the handle, because else the bent tips work against you.<br /><br />On top of that the tines are actually a little overly long. I found that if I partially engage the ejection button but I can much more easily brush my cat because it artificially shortens the tines.  When the tines are fully engaged I basically catch too much and the they end up trying to bend versus navigate their way through the fur.<br /><br />It's possible that I'll be forced to switch to a normal bristle brush and try that but I have had high hopes for this because I'm used to using stiff brushes in order to remove excess fur from pets before.<br /><br />So I guess if I have one complaint it would be basically that I wish the times weren't bent and we're about 30% shorter. Then I could move the brush and any orientation I want and for my pet it would work very well. The deeper tines tend to get just caught and don't drag through the fur as easily.",1648452330980,False,0

B07V9D6QVG,B07V9D6QVG,5.0,Game changer!,This is an amazing product! We live in an area where it rains and snows and we have a fenced-in yard so I want to be able to have our puppy run around outside as much as possible! But I was finding it so hard to clean her paws. And I can't stand dirt which is the hardest part about having a dog!! This product seriously changed all of that. I've posted pictures as proof-I do use a small amount of dog shampoo and fill the cup 2/3 full with water and after a few scrubs in the cup her feet come out clean and the towel barely has any dirt on it! Highly recommend ☺️,1578677325601,True,2

B07114PYXR,B082245PK2,1.0,The zipper detached the first time I used it,I like the fact that it was a locking makeup case. I dislike the fact the zipper doesn't stay on and without the zipper it doesn't lock.  The first time I used it the pulley thing on the zipper detached because the space was too open. I put it back on and squeezed it back shut.  It worked for a little while before the space opened up again and I had to put it back on and squeeze it shut again. The 3rd or 4th time this happened the top of the zipper completely broke off and there's no way to fix it again. Without the zipper top there's no way to lock the bag and it's completely pointless. You would think it'd be mean to where the zipper can't be pulled off especially since that's the main way you lock the bag. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this problem or if maybe I had a default bag.

B07DBWWM6K,B07DBWWM6K,4.0,Very soft wig.,"So I recently had a bad experience with bleaching my hair and had to cut off the damage and they cut almost all of my hair off. So I decided to buy a wig. I have never worn a wig before I usually use clip in extensions but theres nothing to clip them to so here we are. I received this wig in the mail today and it is extremely soft. It feels amazing. I prefer my hair straight so I decided to straighten it... so I said before I've never worn a wig so I dunno if all the little choppy hairs throughout the wig is normal but being straightened they were extremely noticeable. So I probably wouldn't ever wear it straight. Now I did do a little bit of research before I got the wig and I know its supposed to be plucked to match your hairline, I'll have to find someone to help me with that. There is also no visible part which is nice I can have the part plucked where I want it. I have naturally fine hair so the weight of the wig is fine for me but it is thin in my opinion but when I use my extensions I use it for volume and length. This wig only has volume when its wavy/curly. After straightening it and not liking it very much I wet it down in the shower just to see if it would bounce back into curls and it seems to be drying with a nice beach wave to it. I would say it's closer to 18 or 20 inches straight instead of 16 inches. There was no weird smell when I opened it, I noticed some reviews said it smelled of chemicals. I didnt smell anything. It came with a set of false lashes. I only gave it 4 stars because of how thin it is in my opinion. 🤷‍♀️",1539646697152,True,0

Also, since my little girl likes to have her nails painted, I really appreciate the non-toxic nature of this product.  It did struggle a little bit with removing glitter polish (as is to be expected with any nail polish remover), but successfully removed it with only a little effort.  It does leave a bit of an oily film behind, which is nice to moisturize the cuticles, but you will need to make sure your nails are clean of any residue before re-painting your nails.  I really like the dropper as well, as it dispenses just the right amount of nail polish remover onto a cotton ball very easily and without creating a mess.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a promotional discount for evaluation purposes.

B0BS6CDHSF,B0BWTV44D8,5.0,I'm Impressed Enough to Write About It,"One of our cats has a problem with furballs, so we have tried and used a variety of grooming items, with probably five different slicker brushes alone.  A lot of the success with a grooming device depends on if the animal is comfortable and happy with the grooming, and one cat allows it while the tummy troubled one loves it.  The cat that allows this slicker brush dislikes almost every version of grooming, so I’m massively impressed.  The other cat now seeks out being brushed and is quite insistent when someone sits near this brush versus his other usual grooming spot with a different item.  The bristles are quite strong, so if you have sensitive skinned hands, I’d recommend using an oven mitt or something similar when removing hair.  I prefer dog brushes because they’re usually larger, which works better on my cats usually, and this slicker has one of the largest brush areas out of all of the large brushes I have tried.  I didn’t think I’d be impressed enough with a grooming tool to want to write a review, but for something so simple, this is a really well-done slicker brush.",1680120476881,False,0
B01FH2KCMQ,B01FH2KCMQ,5.0,so I am satisfied with this cream,"This cream has actually made a slight difference so far. I have been using this for almost two weeks and I'm starting to notice my breasts do feel fuller. They are still the same size but the shape has improved. I am a former bf mom so they are not as perky as they once were. I wouldn't say this is a replacement for surgery or anything though. For me just seeing any improvement is exciting, so I am satisfied with this cream. I wasn't really expecting this to work in the beginning, I began to see a difference around the third day. I used it twice a day.<br /><br />The smell is a little different. It was musky to me. It doesn't smell bad.. but it could be better. The size is probably enough for a few months, I still have tons so a little goes a long way. The consistency is thick and really blendable. A little nickel sized amount is about what I use each time because it spreads easily. It really just feels like lotion on your skin, it isn't sticky or gel like.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this was the fragrance, the scent is not a scent I would normally wear but since it does seem to benefit my breasts it<br />Is a scent I can live with, I just spray perfume over my shirt and it covers it up.<br /><br />Overall I am happy about this cream, even with the change being suttle so far it still has some affect and that's better than nothing for me. I'm hoping I see more improvement with this in the long run and I will continue using it.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

They felt tight for a couple of hours, like my feet were too big for my skin, but it wasn't uncomfortable - just noticeable. I forgot about it for a couple of days, and by the Saturday after (so 4 days) HUGE chunks of skin were peeling off of my feet. I had an appointment for my first pedicure in a year on Sunday, and the technician was somewhat appalled at the amount of skin she was removing from my feet. Today is Monday, and despite the thorough job the pedicurist did removing the skin, I'm still peeling a bit. I expect this will be done in a couple of days, but the result is unbelievably smooth, soft feet. I will absolutely use these again (and will probably combine with a pedicure again so I don't have to do all the skin peeling myself). The only downside (and this is mentioned on the instructions) is that my feet are a lot more sensitive to temperature and sunlight. So walking around barefoot on the hot concrete at the pool is rather painful, and I had to use higher SPF sunscreen on my feet because the new skin felt like it was frying in the sun. It didn't burn, it was just uncomfortable. Overall, I'm very pleased with the product and will absolutely purchase again!",1500923217997,True,30

B07H2TPSZ8,B07H2TPSZ8,3.0,Does not feel like it can straighten hair at the roots but love the low heating temp.,"I have tried a number of these brushes.  What I like about this one is that it goes down to 80C (176F).  It was so cool that I was not sure it was on.  I have fine hair, high porosity that is 5 months post-straightening relaxer.  And, I find that light heat with a silicone-based glosser helps to gently close the cuticle and to keep my roots from tangling.  What I don’t like is that this brush design does not have the round guiding bristles around the edges that help to pull your hair into the hearing plate.  So, it feels like you are brushing your hair with your elbow and that it is not penetrating to the roots.  You have to grip the hair with your other hand so it feels like you are only getting the shaft of your hair.  So, the brush is best for people with longer hair who do not have curly roots or those who need the super low heat setting as an option.<br /><br />If you would like to be able to rake the brush over your roots to tame curls at 250 F and up, other bushes  to consider are https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FGV9NQG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1 or https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071HFQGJX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

B07F8PCLDV,B07F8PCLDV,4.0,Not bad but there are better choices,"This is the 2nd hair straightener I've had the opportunity to try.  The other is the Furiden Professional Hair Straightener Titanium Flat Iron.  I'm going to write this review as a comparison between the two since they are in the same price range.  For starters, both heat up quickly, have variable temperature settings, automatic shut off and a swivel cord.  The Autenpoo (who comes up with these brand names???) brand has a mechanical on/off switch that also serves as the heat selector.  I prefer this over the Furiden which has on/off buttons and up/down buttons to set the temp on a digital screen.  If I want, I can leave the Autenpo's dial set on the temp I want (the lowest setting it has), unplug it when I'm done, plug it in the next day and it will just turn on and go to my favorite temp.  With the Furiden, I have to hold a button down to turn it on and then hit the down button 4 or 5 times to go to the lowest temp.  The Autenpoo also comes with a comb, some hair clips to section your hair during styling and a heat protective glove, and has a slide lock to keep it shut when not in use.  In all other aspects however, I prefer the Furiden.  Autenpoo's cord is super thick bulky, seriously like a vacuum cleaner cord.  It will probably last forever but adds unnecessary bulk and weight which would be especially problematic for traveling.  The main advantage Furiden has is the pointed end.  Not only is it better suited to tight areas close to your scalp or neckline but it can also help section your hair without needing a comb or your fingers.  Furthermore, the plates, which are longer overall, extend into the pointed tip to get the heat right where you need it.  Both of these irons do a perfectly fine job, but I just find the Furiden easier to use.",1543606158063,False,1

I still sort of don’t believe that these little cloths can just wipe away all that makeup so easily but they do!<br />Yes it is additional steps vs ready to use makeup wipe but they work so much better and have already saved me so much money by not having to buy disposable makeup wipes any more! Buy them, totally worth it!",1656902046607,True,4

B08DNCR582,B08DNCR582,5.0,Beyond my expectations,"So even though I used to do hair and should know about magnetic eyelashes, I didn’t and I was SO skeptical. I finally decided to try them. These things exceeded my expectations by far! The first time I chose the not so dramatic ones but they were thicker than my own. They did great. They were only a tad heavy. They stayed on 8 hours but I took the eyeliner with me to work and touched them up. I honestly think they would’ve stayed on longer if I hadn’t have forgotten and put regular eyeliner on first out of habit. I do wish this came in another color besides black as I have blonde hair and it’s dramatic. But once I wore them a while I realized it looked good. After work, I removed them easily. My eyes were itchy a little but when I woke up that evening they were back to normal. Another reason I think they didn’t stay on 12 hours was instead of following directions, I read somewhere that a person put the eyeliner on the the lashes while still wet and it worked better. The next night I followed directions. Put a coat on let dry then add another coat. Honestly, it pretty much dries by the time you finish both eyes. Don’t forget to shake it up though. They were very easy and quick to do. The only real time it takes is deciding which ones to use as there are so many nice selections. I realized the ones I thought were too dramatic when choosing actually look the best. I’ve gotten o many complements. And this time they stayed on all night. I think I could sleep in them and they would stay on. I wouldn’t though. The corners might poke your skin on inner eye when you close them but this can be remedied by snipping a tad off with scissors once you try them on and see how they do. I didn’t have to trim mine. Also, I had put a pair on and decided I liked the longer ones better so I took off the first ones and applied the others. I never redid the eyeliner. They still worked and stayed on. There’s magnet particles on eyeliner and the lashes are on a magnet strip. They are easy to remove but stay on like they are real. That sounds crazy. I didn’t want to ruin my own lashes with the glue kind plus I can’t get them on good enough without adjusting them. These you can take off and adjust. This gave me confidence I lacked in doing this. Plus, my hands aren’t that steady. When removing, start at corner and peel off. They won’t hurt your lashes. To remove eyeliner I used cold cream. It worked well. Just water doesn’t work. It is waterproof very much so. So cry all you want with these lashes ladies. You won’t have to worry about them falling off.

B002GDKPUY,B002GDKPUY,5.0,Shows AMAZING color on brown hair!,"I love love LOVE this dye!!!!<br />(TL;DR at bottom)<br />I have medium to dark brown hair, and the thought of bleaching it terrifies me because the last time I bleached my hair in high school I absolutely FRIED it. I was pretty hesitant to see how well this pink would show up on my dark hair without bleaching it first. Boy was I surprised.<br />First of all, I have a LOT of hair. I needed 3 bottles of dye to cover my whole head. Hopefully you can use my photos to compare your hair length to mine and use what I said to help you determine how many bottles you’d need to buy.<br />I didn’t just pour it in my hands and rub it all over my hair, I actually sectioned out my hair piece by piece to make sure I got the dye on every last bit of hair as evenly as possible. This whole process took about 2 hours. Yes, it was exactly as awful as it sounds. Man were my arms tired.. After I finished dying it, I put all of my hair up in a shower cap / bonnet and let it sit for 5 whole hours. Excessive? Probably lol.<br />I swear I remember hearing once a long time ago that when you wash out hair dye in the shower you’re supposed to keep washing it til the water runs clear. Well I was in the shower for a good 40 minutes shampooing the life outta my hair before I just gave up and got out the shower lol. My shower water continued to run pink every time I washed my hair for at least a good 2 to 3 weeks.<br />Oh and as for the washing?? Yeah I hate cold water so I never did any of that stuff that you’re supposed to do. I continued to shower every to every other day, and I used warm to hot water every time. Yeah yeah I know the color won’t last as long, but screw a cold shower. I also switched to using Herbal Essences Color Me Happy shampoo.<br />[EDIT: I am now aware that Color Me Happy is actually horrible for colored hair. That shampoo still contains SULFATES, which is the ENEMY OF HAIR DYE. So yeah make sure you read the ingredients on your shampoo bottles carefully, because clearly Herbal Essences is a bunch of LIARS.]<br />So after 1 month of warm showers and Herbal Essences, the third photo is what I was left with. I’m honestly incredibly happy!!! The pink definitely faded a lot, but there was still enough pink in my hair to the point where if a stranger on the street saw me they’d be able to say “that girl has pink(ish) hair.” This dye has exceeded all of my expectations.<br />One thing I’d like to add, though. This dye does seem to stain plastic showers. It kinda comes off when you scrub it with acetone (nail polish remover) and some abrasive cleaners. Over time the stains definitely do fade. But I just wanted to give y’all the heads up in case your shower turns pink and you can’t scrub it all off in one night.<br />I’m about to re-dye my hair with this same dye as soon as I finish writing this review, so it might even be brighter and last even longer this time!<br />~TL;DR~<br />1. Shows up great on medium brown hair, but I let it sit for 5 hours before washing.<br />2. Long hair (or at least mine) requires 3 bottles.<br />3. Stains plastic showers.<br />4. Color stays in nicely after a month of daily warm showers and using Herbal Essences Color Me Happy shampoo & conditioner.",1552851725428,True,70

If you have curly hair it's difficult to use a regular cotton towel as it causes too much disruption to the curls and makes your hair frizzy.  I didn't realize but these are just like a towel and my hair is super frizzy after I sleep with it on.  Also I can't get these to stay tight on my head.  You have to hook the towel through this small elastic band and it hardly meets it.  It's always falling off my head.

I have many health related issues as side effects from past cancer treatments as well as fibromyalgia, chronic pain and permanent nerve damage all over my body and a bulging disc in my lower back... etc. I get unexplained muscle pain...same with my tendons, you name it..it will hurt at some point. I'm getting to the point that i am tired of taking all these chemicals and medications that only make me tired and cranky. I'd rather deal with the most of my pain with heat/ice therapy and massage (so long as it doesn't hurt my skin). I cannot tell you enough how much I absolutely love these rollers. And its a great idea to have more then one going in the freezer at all times. When I am hot and tired from a hot flash I can roll it on the back of my neck and on my face and I am instantly awake! Its refreshing! It helps all my muscle aches and pains that aren't helped with heat. I even used them last night when I was attacked by a swarm of Florida mosquitoes out in the yard. I was a mess....scratching my legs like crazy until I went and grabbed an ice roller and started rolling away all the itch and burn from the bites. One of my medicines makes bug bites leave huge welts on me and they itch and last for days and days longer than normal. Having had cancer twice like I have...I'd rather not use all those sprays and chemicals either. So I try to cover up and stay inside but sometimes you have to be out there in a hurry, like last night and well...you know the rest. I have been given the chance to purchase these Derma Ice Rollers at a discount for my unbiased and honest review. I honestly can't say anything bad about the product.

Not perfect but overall okay!,"Excellent set of brushes with pretty good quality.<br />#1 rule when buying Bella and bear products: get on their email list for discount codes! I paid a little more than half of the current price for this set. Even at full price it's a good value (price per brush) but due to a few quirks I recommend not paying full price.<br />I'm a makeup junkie and own many brushes ranging from handmade very expensive Japanese brushes to easily accessible drug-store brand sets. I prefer synthetic brushes due to allergies and skin sensitives and I believe most of these are synthetic or blends.<br />The set arrived from Amazon in a very nice giftable thick sturdy box. I'm actually using the box and lid as liners in  one of my makeup drawers.<br />I have broken down this review into two sections brushes and the case.<br />Brushes:<br />Handles are semi-matte black and the ferules are silver metal and appear to be crimped on which is very nice. The handles/ferules remind me of IT Cosmetics brushes. They are very well made, heavier constructed, and feature the company and brush name stamped on them.<br />Brush quality is good over all. Except for one of the brushes, they are all  very soft and the density is appropriate for the applications.<br />Foundation, stippling, large shadow, and smudge shadow brushes are not evenly cut. There is noticeable uneven brush hairs with all 4 of these. The application with these particular brushes is okay but it's not as smooth as it would be with perfectly cut brushes.<br />The flat yellow brush is made of a taklon or nylon type material. It's large, thick, flat, and useless. It doesn't work with any kind of makeup in any kind of application because as soon as it touches skin, it splays, or splits. It's not flexible or functional. I have put it aside for craft applications, as it might work to pat on glue or something like that.<br />MY favorite brushes are the white shadow blending blushes, they work very well for blending shadow lines.<br />Runners up are the larger powder brushes for setting powder and bronzer/blush applications.<br />Even with the damage to the portfolio, some brushes are not cut properly, and one is useless, this is still an excellent value.<br />3-3.5 stars because the  handle quality is really 4 star quality and most of the brushes are 4-5 star quality but there are some misses here too.<br />No issues with irritations or sensitivity which is very important to me.<br /><br />Portfolio:<br />My large heavy portfolio arrived in fair condition. The zipper, doesn't work properly, and after opening I can't easily zip it again it. This is not a big deal for me because I will not be regularly using my brushes in this case. There was a pamphlet in the bottom of the box with brush descriptions and it made a permanent indentation in the case, which would be unfortunate if I was going to use the case for storage.<br />The larger brushes all came with mesh brush guards, the smaller brushes were wrapped in plastic.",1511741749636,False,1

You can't even run your fingers through it without strands coming out. It is a nuisance, especially when you have to comb and style the hair. The hair also gets tangled easily and is a chore to brush and detangle.<br /><br />The hair color is the only redeemable quality preventing it from receiving a 1 star rating, but even THAT is flawed. The color is lighter and pinker than what is shown in the model photos (which shows a more purple color). However, the color is still pretty and I received compliments on it.<br /><br />Overall, I would not purchase this product again. If the hair had little to no shedding, I would give it 3 stars.

So, I use these clips daily to help keep my hair looking like I love myself.  Having so many is nice because I don't have to worry about losing some.  I also use them to keep my hair drying bonnet from opening up due to the air pressure.  And, I use them to hold my towel closed.  BUT, oftentimes, the silicone breaks.  So, I wanted a large quantity to help make up for this.  So, I deducted a star due to the lack of durability of the silicone - once it breaks, the hold feels much, much firmer.  I wish that there was a way to reattach it.  But, all in all, this is a great value in terms of quantity but could be better in durability.",1631058306704,True,0

B07LF3RPHM,B07LF3RPHM,4.0,"Not the best, not the worst, but a savior in times of Covid.","I was disappointed when they arrived because the color was significantly darker than what is shown on the product page. Rather than golden blond and bleached blonde it was more like a mostly dark blond/light brown (with a reddish cast) with a little bit of bleached blond thrown in.<br /><br />But I decided to work with it. I colored it lighter which ended up bringing out the red (not a good thing with my coloring), so I used a toner, and finally got to a point where they would blend in with my existing (and VERY spendy) extensions.<br /><br />Although I don't look forward to spending $300 each time I have my existing extensions re-tightened and refreshed, it's a necessary evil and I'm not willing to go back to my thinning hair (radiation therapy, no thyroid, menopause and weight loss made me worry I'd wake up one morning looking like Jean Luc Picard.) But as the Covid months wore on, I found that an unanticipated benefit was that doing your own salon treatments at home saves a hella lot of money.<br /><br />Fortunately, my husband was watching the first time I had my extensions installed. As I faced not being able to get them refreshed during lockdown, he suggested that I let him try removing the hangers-on and reinstalling the new ones. I was doubtful but fresh out of alternatives.<br /><br />After watching every extensions installation video on youtube, he gave it a try. With some of my original extensions biting the dust during removal or the falling-out process, I needed a few extra to bolster the thickness, thus my purchase of these extensions.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Cheap. A fraction of the cost that I spent at my high end salon (which was over $1000 with initial installation). So, you can hardly argue with the cost.<br />- Once I got the color right, they seem to behave and feel the same as my existing pricey extensions.<br />- Shipped quickly.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Thinnish near the ends. Thickness peters out more than it should.<br />- Color significantly different from the thumbnail on the product page. (Probably less of a problem if you're not trying to match them to existing extensions and are not super picky about color.)<br />- Cheap enough to buy several and get a very thick mane o' hair.<br /><br />WOULD I RECOMMEND?<br />Yes. With the caveat about color.<br /><br />LONG STORY SHORT: I doubt I'll ever return to the pricey salon for extensions (unless these extensions don't stand the test of time.) Being able to buy these extensions and installation tools on Amazon, and being able to watch How To vids on youtube (and having a husband willing to do the deed) will probably save me about $2000 a year or more.",1594760261289,True,2

(Seemingly, old AC and NiCd models spin faster than old NiMH models; YMMV.)<br />(ii) This model is no more adjustable (N/M/S) for closeness of shave than my old adjustable model (1-10).  The heads do indeed rock more than the old spring suspension, but I still must stretch my skin with the other hand to get a close shave over the bumps.<br />(iii) The cleaning system leaves stubble-grit on the rubber bits.  Also mine required repairs after 5 months, because the washer mechanism got stuck.  (It has a 2-year warranty (yay!), alas they insisted on shipping the razor back, too (aargh!).)  Norelco's attempt to ""Gillette up a revenue stream"" with consumables, i.e. cleanser fluid, is a little transparent.<br />(iv) The cleaning system leaves you with a damp razor, even if you shake it and let it stand for an entire day -- it's the shaving equivalent of a wet willie in the morning.  Worse, the small quantity of liquid remaining is just enough to create a jumpy slide across the face -- not as even as completely dry, nor as smooth as a lubricated wet shave.<br /><br />On the plus side, the battery life on this razor is excellent, and longer than old Norelcos.  If you live out of a suitacase, you won't have to pack the cord.  Which is good, because the charger circuit has been pulled out of the razor body and into a wall wart.<br /><br />The razor rates 4 stars (not 5 because they have made better razors before, and hopefully will hence).  The cleaning system gets 1 star.  So don't get a CC model, but definitely do buy a Norelco razor.  If you switch from blade or foil electric, please do as the manual says: give it two weeks of rotary use before judging the closeness of the shave.  But especially if it's your first razor, grasshopper, you will be hooked for life!",1143873624000,True,24

B08YYLJLQJ,B08YYLJLQJ,4.0,"Works great! Double beachy wave, Heatless curling system.","This works great! You just have to know how to use it correctly. The double curler band allows you to use less hair on each curler so that the hair dries faster and curls faster. Here IS MY 2 HOURS TO PRETTY CURLS METHOD: Part upper hair at crown of head,  and put hair from the upper head at crown,  in a pony tail for later. Snap the curling system closed, so that there is 2 round circle bands to use to curl with, and put both around head like a double crown head band. Push the top curling band where pont tail is for later use. Separate the bottom layer of hair into two parts... left side and right side and use only the bottom circle band curler for the bottom portion of head. Begin curling in left side by spritzing a little water onto the hair at root and curl it under band tucking it under and around curler one time only and then in next pass, grab a little more hair with it and continue going around the curler band. Keep spritzing new hair with water each time you pick up a new piece of hair and add that hair to the previous end of the one you just curled, until the whole left, bottom  side is done. Then start on the bottom right side of hair. When finished,  the  whole bottom curling band  will be filled with the hair from the lower portion of. Now it's time to take out the pony tail that was  on the grown of head  and put that hair under the second curling band and separate the left side of hair from the right. Start curling the left upper part of head as you did the bottom portion... spritzing small portion of hair with water at root and curling it once around the band and then pick up a little more new hair, spritz it with water and curl together with the former portion around band until all left side is done and now do right side. DO NOT SOAK HAIR.  Only LIGHTLY MIST IT a little with water or it wont dry in 2 hours. Dont curl too big a portion of hair at a time either, or it won't dry in two hours. Wait about 1 hour to 2 hours and remove curlers and you will get beachy type ringlets that are big. It takes about 10 minutes to wind hair around curlers. Lovely curls.",1619827562355,True,19

As I am not an expert in skin care products I had no idea what to expect. My girlfriend and I are going on a cruise in a month and I started tanning. The tanning has made noticeable some small lines around my eyes that I am not a big fan of. So far this Hyaluronic Serum has decreased these. It has a nice pump and is easy to control how much comes out. I did receive this at a value price to give a legit and fair evaluation. So far it is working well and the normal price seems very fair.

If melatonin pills don't work for you then maybe it's just your brain chemistry, but this works better for me than any sleeping bill or melatonin pill and with the added benefit of relaxing my muscles in a similar way that an Epsom salt bath would. I'm not sure it makes me fall asleep necessarily, but I notice that my sleep is definitely deeper and I wake up feeling way more well rested and as if my sleep was richer and more effective. I really love it and keep a supply on hand always. It's great for airplane rides and right after you shower before bed.<br />I read one review here that someone said it was sticky and stayed on their skin, but then followed up with how they were on a vacation on an island and couldn't shower for 2 days. Haha, way to blame this great product for your bad travel choices. The lotion is not sticky and I really only just put a little on my index finger tip and thumb tip and give myself a neck massage with it to rub it in and on any other sore spots. That coupled with my firm mattress and I sleep so well.<br />Drink plenty of water througout the day, and don't drink any alcohol or beverages before bed and maybe try a warm soothing shower or bath before bed. Rub some of this lotion on the back of your neck and shoulders and in the soft skin spots like your elbow and knee pits so it will soak in well. You will have wonderful dreams and wake up feeling as if your REM sleep went deeper and longer than before. Don't look at electronics before bed and make sure you are sleeping in a cool dark room and are clearing your mind of worrying thoughts. It's really a great tool in your sleep tool box.<br />Remember that sleeping pills, especially crazy ones like ambien ... and alcohol too, are so bad for your sleep and sleep is the most important thing you can do for yourself. I love the fact that I really can go without coffee in the morning when I have a great long sleep. And my appetite totally changes and I crave health foods instead of unhealthy ones.",1436976242000,True,20

B01M655RA6,B01M655RA6,4.0,Great set on a budget with one caveat.,"This is a great little set of brushes for the price, but there are definitely some things that could be improved here. First, these really do apply foundation (liquid and powder) very well. I've used these with K-Beauty BB creams, stick foundations (Hourglass and FitMe), FitMe and Clinique liquid foundations, and BareMinerals powder foundation. Some of these require a beauty blend-type sponge on top to get a flawless finish, but most do not. I definitely use less product using these brushes, which has a bit of a learning curve - the first couple times I looked like a weirdo with way too much caked on. I mostly use the small round and the medium oval brush. The medium oval I use for foundation and sometimes cream contour/blush. The little round brush is AMAZING for cream shadows, especially ColourPop shadows.<br /><br />These are very easy to clean and I haven't had problems with them shedding fibers after washing. This set comes with a nice little branded cotton bag for storage/travel. My *only* complaint about these is the solidity of the heads and their connection to the handles. Although mine haven't broken (yet) I feel like I have to be really gentle with these. The plastic creeks a bit when you use them and just feels fragile. I've thought about adding something like Sugru to the handles to make them sturdier, but for now they're holding up.",1491625337000,True,1

The water diverter is metal, as is one of the adaptors.  The rest of the adaptors are white plastic.  All of the adaptors have male threads on both sides.  The threads on the diverter are female, and the threads in your faucet which your old aerator screwed in to need to be female as well.  The metal adaptor fit our old (1970's / 1980's) Moen faucets.<br /><br />I measured the outside diameter of the threaded part of each of the adaptors - the part that screws into your faucet.  Here are the diameters: 0.68-0.69&#34;, 0.76-0.77&#34;, 0.83-0.84&#34;, 0.92&#34; (this is the metal one), and 1.07-1.08&#34;.  The other side of each of the adaptors (the side that screws into the diverter) measures 0.83-0.84&#34;.<br /><br />I am impressed by the high-quality silicone gaskets that came with the unit.  I experienced no leaks.<br /><br />My faucets are the type where you pull the handle upward to turn it on.  This makes it tricky to precisely adjust the water pressure, so the pressure is high enough to wash out food particles, but not so high it is painful to use.

The hair is wonderfully soft and is very nice to wear. The lace is very hard to see and the knots are very small, so I did not feel the need to bleach them. In addition, none of the wefting is visible and it looks incredibly natural. However, this wig does have its catches. First of all, it tangles super easily, though that is to be expected for a long synthetic wig. Because of this, I took off a star and would only recommend this wig for pictures, not for everyday wear. In addition, it is NOT very heat resistant. After I took these pictures, I tried to style it some more and ended up ruining the wig, even though my iron was on the lowest setting. When heated, the hair gets scraggily and odd-looking so I would only recommend this wig if you do not intend on styling it with heat.

B00SZ0Y6TI,B00SZ0Y6TI,2.0,"Bad for everyday use, but smells amazing","The first ingredient in this product is Cyclopentasiloxane, which is silicone.  While this product has a sweet and subtle scent that is lovely on the hair, habitual silicone use is fundamentally damaging to hair. (Go research Biosilk, a more popular silicone-based hair serum.)<br /><br />Silicone does create a lovely temporary shine, and it doesn't weigh hair down much. But over time it increases damage, accelerating coarse frizzy hair or split ends.  This would make the product addictive: masking the damage CAUSES the damage being covered up.<br /><br />Who knows, this one may have some effect as claimed in shielding from UV exposure (though I doubt 3-5 drops distributed in a head of damp hair could amount to much sunscreen coverage).  And perhaps the Argan oil or other components can balance the effects of the primary silicone ingredient. I wouldn't risk that. I'd use this protector oil for a special occasion for extra pop, shine and an appearance of good grooming, but only with the understanding that occasional use won't cause much harm.  It isn't heroin, and using it once won't make you an addict -- just go into it with your eyes open.<br /><br />Might work for someone who has short, fast-growing hair, where they cut off the hair before damaging effects can become a chronic issue.",1431805296000,False,29

B000PKKAGO,B000PKKAGO,2.0,Robot in disguise?,"At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can't be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as ""Frenzy"" in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it's on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband's) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than a pretty face, and isn't for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There's a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it's time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you're pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There's a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men's facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You'll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn't very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don't need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I'm afraid I'll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007",1197914295000,False,8

B001GILLJ4,B001GILLJ4,1.0,Did not work for me,"Let me begin this review by stating that I have been using Egyptian, Indian and Pakistani 100% henna for over 30 years with beautiful results that lasted a full 3 months.  I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I'm dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it's messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine.  I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  Based on my experience, I'd have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don't work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning).  Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.)  Leaves me to wonder if the gray hairs would not be gray had I followed the advice of the other henna/indigo distributors.  Here's a good reference website:  [...]",1339963084000,False,5

They come packaged in a very nice white cotton draw string bag with cute little baby boy on the front.  Inside the bag is a clear plastic bag containing the 4 bibs.  The front of each bib is made of 100% cotton and the backing is a very soft 100% polyester.  The backing would be very soft on the baby's bare skin if they were not wearing a shirt.  I like the fact that the maker took that into consideration, little details like that mean a lot to me.  There are two snaps for closure which allows for adjustment as the baby grows.  The stitching around the edges is very nice and there weren't corners cut in the bib assembly.<br /><br />The bibs came in 4 different unique patterns for boys.  2 - Nautical themed bibs one white with sailboats, whales and captain's wheel and the second is a navy blue with white anchors.  1- White with navy, orange and grey air planes.  1 - medium blue with navy bicycles.<br /><br />I was very satisfied with the quality of bibs I received and I highly recommend these for baby shower gifts, baby gift baskets etc.  My daughter used the pointed tips of this type of bib when she was teething to chew on.  Because of the shape they catch the drool well and keep from ruining those really cute expensive outfits that we all invest in.<br /><br />*A sample of this product was provided to me free for testing and review.

Not sure what's up with that.  It wasn't hurting her, I think maybe since it grabbed so much hair, maybe she didn't like the extra little ""tug"".  There are 2 different curves to the brush and I didn't really notice a difference in the effects.  I also tried to rake the rug, which I have done with my usual brush.  This was absolutely not working with this one.  It grabbed so much it was actually lifting the carpet.  This worked on fine cat hair, so I can only imagine how well it would grab the hair and de-shed a dog.  I didn't have any use for the added light and strap.

I'm not going to go into details about all the things everyone else has already said, but I do have a fantastic tip to share.<br /><br />Lay down on the bed while brushing! Brushing at the sink for 2 or 3 minutes seems like an eternity (especially if you are one of those people who often gets the toothpaste drooling down your chin). Laying down while brushing is one of the best ideas I have ever had. Try this for at least a week and you will be hooked!  Relax. Let the toothbrush do the work while you lay down and relax. Enjoy the feeling of the toothbrush massaging your gums and cleaning your teeth. Take your time, and RELAX! (I know, I keep saying relax over and over, but seriously, try taking a little meditation and relaxation break). This makes a mundane chore actually quite enjoyable.  If you do this, you will find that you brush longer, and you AND your dentist will notice the results. WARNING! Wait until you get back to the sink to brush your tongue so you don't gag or choke.<br /><br />By the way, I also have a Sonicare and use it on a regular basis but I prefer this one because it's more controllable.",1166639532000,False,1

Just buff the edge towards the center and peel it off..<br />- to avoid getting cut with the sharp edge, glue it with a thin cardboard before using. I just use a Cherios box.

B00FBGIXUC,B00FBGIXUC,3.0,"Weird wig, but it worked","I used this as part of my Peg Bundy costume for Halloween. I had to make some adjustments, but in the end it worked and looked pretty good. First off, the wig cap itself is oddly large in the top. I think this is how it gets the height for the ""bump"" of the hair. But when wearing it, it's just empty space between the top of the wig cap and the top of your head. And it's not structured at all to help it hold that shape. So I did what any 80's-90's kid would do, and put bump-its on my head, underneath the wig to help fill out that part and give it structure. Also, a headband was necessary to cover up where the bangs meet the rest of the hair, as it was just really weird looking. Then a little teasing and a little aqua net and boom--good to go. I will say also that the wig cap rubbed on my ears uncomfortably, probably compounded by the fact that I had to wear a headband with it. I mean, it's a costume wig, so you get what you get with those, but this was my experience with this purchase.",1667144109711,True,0

B08BY7K5T1,B08BY7K5T1,3.0,Just my honesty,"Honest review:<br />Okay so I have worn this wig since Saturday and today is Tuesday. My take on the wig since its been washed, knots bleached and flat ironed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Wig didnt smell<br />Is very full and has body<br />Knots bleached easier than expected<br />Lace blends well against skin..may want to use glue rather than hair spray bc it don't hold well.<br />Wig looks good and dried well after washing.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Alot of fly aways, thinner ends in frontal<br />Construction isnt the best. The wig has a track seperating the frontal from the sewn bundles which is irritating because the part isnt that long which leaves me with the only option; remove it or monitor whether its showing or not which is uncomfortable bc a wig shouldnt expose you. This irritates me BIG !!!!<br />The frontal of the wig is whispy and not as full as the back. Im not sure if its the humidity outside or not but I flatironed it this morning and it looks more of a body wave in the front and straight in the back. Most bobs dont look like that, so this was is a must for me.<br />Wig cap is HUGE. If tou have an average sized small head you will have to customize this unit. I do understand that they make them to where they can be adjusted to the customers liking abd or big head friendly bc everyones head comes in different sizes but I struggled today lol. I reconstructed the whole wig in the back. I took four tracks out the back and cut the comb out and replaced it to help on the track line and sewed it through the cap for the much needed support. I had to cut the sides down as well bc it was really bulky. I sewed the band that came with the wig into the wig as well to hold the bulkeness down more. When I say I was tired I was but all in all I like it better now, my head is just small. Hopefully I can figure this seperatung track out. I may just use this wig when I want to pull the hair up or something bc I cant be worried about this. 😬 Im not sure of anyone else experienced this with their purchase, but it may have been just mine. I will update once it get colder as far as the hair spray sticking good and the the whispyness of the sides that cant seem to stay straigh all day.",1598391132614,True,4

Sure, it does not bluetooth connect to your smartphone, have an LCD display, or multiple brushing modes, but the fact of the matter is that most people will only ever turn their brush off and on. I use the Oral B Triumph myself, because I received it as a free promotional item while still a dental hygiene student, but my daughter uses the Healthy Clean. I used it once by accident and found the battery power to be the same as the Triumph's, but with a lighter handle design. Also, let's face it, the Healthy Clean can be had in hot pink. You can't go wrong with this brush. If I had to go replace my own brush today, I would buy a Healthy Clean.",1395193784000,False,4

B01CILZXWI,B01CILZXWI,5.0,Definitely recommend. Buy here & save yourself some money!,"This whitening treatment is amazing. I have super sensitive teeth & have tried many over the counter options but could not continue through the whole treatment series due to sensitivity issues. The first time I completed 10 trays as recommended by my dentist. I purchased that first package from them for $89.99 (toothpaste not included in their price). On the 3rd tray I had some sensitivity & preservered thru it as recommended for optimal whitening. No sensitivity noted with all following treatments. A month later, I found this on Amazon ($69.99 with toothpaste!!) and purchased. Had some sensitivity where it did burn my gum line (gums turned white after whitening treatment) from biting down too hard and getting some excess whitening agent on my gum line. Tried to keep going but stopped bc it hurt really bad and different from the pain from just tooth sensitivity. I let it heal & continued a few days later. Concerned it was due to just being an Amazon product and not the same as what I bought at the dental office, I bit the bullet & purchased another from the dental office and compared everything: boxes (same), expiration dates (legit), trays (same design). When I buy again, I will definitely save myself $20 & go on Amazon & get some free toothpaste. My teeth are noticeably whiter. And whitened 1.5 shades in a box's worth.
